# Contributing to Atomic Heart Menu

Thanks for your interest. This is a beta, solo, amateur project. The bar is "make
it better without breaking the crash-safety model", not "perfect code". These
rules keep the codebase consistent and keep pull requests and issues easy to
review.

## Ground rules

- **Single-player only.** Do not add anything that targets multiplayer or online
  play. Atomic Heart has no multiplayer, and this project will never support
  cheating against other players.
- **License.** This project is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later with the
  attribution terms in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE). By contributing you agree that:
  - your contribution is licensed under the same GPL-3.0-or-later terms,
  - you have the right to submit it, and
  - attribution to the author and to the third-party tools (Dumper-7, MinHook,
    Dear ImGui) stays intact.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues first. For anything non-trivial, open an issue to discuss
  the approach before you send a pull request.
- Keep changes focused: one logical change per pull request.

## Building

Confirm your change compiles in Release before opening a pull request:

```bat
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Outputs land in `bin\`. The dumped game SDK is not required to build.

## Code style

- Match the surrounding code. When in doubt, copy the style of the file you edit.
- C++17. Four-space indentation, no tabs. Allman braces (the opening brace goes on
  its own line), as in the existing code.
- Descriptive names. Avoid abbreviations that the codebase does not already use.
- Keep the SPDX and copyright header at the top of every new source file. Copy it
  from an existing file.

## Crash-safety rules (non-negotiable)

This DLL must never crash the game. Follow the existing safety model:

- Guard **every** game-memory dereference with `Mem::IsReadable` before you read or
  write it.
- Wrap any risky operation (anything that calls into game code) in `try/catch`. The
  build uses `/EHa`, so `catch(...)` also traps access violations.
- Do not run structural or heavy work on the render (Present) thread. Use the
  worker thread or the game-thread pump, the way the existing features do.
- Re-validate cached actors immediately before each `ProcessEvent`; they can go
  stale between frames.
- Do not reintroduce the native nav / behavior-tree calls that were deliberately
  removed for crashing.

## Offsets and SDK

- Build-specific offsets live in `src/sdk/offsets.h`. Document where each value
  came from in the dumped SDK, the way the existing entries do.
- Use the full `/Script/...` names for functions, or `FindFunctionInClass` for
  blueprint-mounted classes.

## Documentation

- Project rule: when you change code or behavior, update `README.md` **and**
  `PROJECT_AND_SDK.md` in the same pull request so the docs do not go stale.
- Docs style: plain hyphens only. No em dashes or en dashes.

## Commit messages

- Use the imperative mood in the subject ("Add fly speed slider", not "Added" or
  "Adds").
- Keep the subject under about 72 characters, capitalized, with no trailing period.
- Leave a blank line, then a body that explains **what** changed and **why**, not
  just how.
- Reference issues in the body or footer (for example, "Fixes #12").
- Keep each commit a single coherent change. Do not mix unrelated edits.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main` with a short, descriptive name (for example
  `feature/object-spawn` or `fix/ammo-restore`).
- Fill in the pull request template.
- State exactly what you tested: which game build, and what you verified in-game.
- Make sure it compiles in Release and adds no new warnings.
- Keep the diff minimal and on-topic. No drive-by reformatting of unrelated code.

## Issues

- Use the issue templates.
- **Bug reports** must include your game version/build, steps to reproduce, what
  you expected, what happened, and the `AtomicHeartMenu.log` file. Logs are the
  single most useful thing you can attach.
- **Feature requests** should describe the use case, not just the feature.
